% -------------------- 海洋学定义
\IEEEPARstart{O}{cean} front, defined as a narrow transition zone between water masses with different properties\cite{definition}, is a ubiquitous feature of the global ocean.
The frontal regions are characterized by enhanced horizontal gradients of temperature, salinity, and other characteristics. 
% -------------------- SSTF
Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fronts are widely detected due to the abundance of remote sensing data related to SST.
% Sea Surface Temperature (SST) largely represents the character of a water mass and the corresponding observations are abundant, so SST fronts are widely used to ocean front detection.
% -------------------- 海洋锋检测的重要性。
Ocean front detection plays a key role in fishery productivity, ocean-atmosphere interaction and marine environmental protection.
% The intensity of frontal regions is closely related to catch and often coincides with the distribution of important fishery\cite{?}.
% Moreover, fronts are often accompanied by convergence of seawater, which can accumulate floating debris, oil pollution, heavy metals and other substances\cite{?}.
% Therefore, ocean front detection plays a key role in some applications, such as fishery productivity and marine environmental protection.

% -------------------- 传统方法的优缺点
Traditional methods for ocean front detection mainly include statistical methods and gradient thresholding methods. 
Although they are the most intuitive from the perspective of oceanography, they tend to detect false fronts due to imperfect data or interference from background noise, thereby negatively impacting visual interpretation.
% From the perspective of oceanography, they are the most intuitive and enable rapid frontal identification.
% However, they tend to detect false fronts due to inperfect data or interference from background noise, thereby negatively impacting visual interpretation.
% -------------------- 基于CNN的深度学习方法
% -------------------- tuxiangfenlei分类
In recent years, many deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been applied to ocean front detection.
Lima et al.\cite{deep:fenlei1} used fine-tuning AlexNet to determine whether small patchs from SST image contain frontal region.
On this basis, Sun et al.\cite{deep:fenlei2} proposed a multiscale deep framework (MDF) to overlapped the SST regions of different scales to achieve fine-grained location of ocean fronts.
% -------------------- 边缘检测
Li et al.\cite{deep:wein} formulated ocean front detection as a edge detection problem and proposed the Weak Edge Identification Network (WEIN) to detect ocean fronts in SST gradient images.
Based on that, Zhu et al.\cite{deep:BPAFNet} built the Bi-Directional Progressive Fusion Attention Network (BPFANet) that can enrich multiscale ocean front features and reduce background noise.
% -------------------- 语义分割

architecture to locate significant frontal zones in grayscale SST images.

% -------------------- 多类海洋锋检测的意义
Multi-class ocean front detection aims to identify and distinguish various classes of ocean fronts at different regions.
% -------------------- 现有研究对比锋的时空分布
Many existing studies have focused on comparing the spatial and temporal distribution of different classes of ocean fronts.
% 
Thus, an automated multi-class ocean front detection method can substantially contribute to such research.
% -------------------- LSENet
Xie et al.\cite{LSENet} proposed a semantic segmentation model called Location and Seasonality Enhancement Network (LSENet) for multi-class ocean front detection at the pixel level.

% -------------------- 提出问题
In multi-class ocean front detection, there is a dilemma in accurately identifying Small Target Fronts (STFs).
% -------------------- 小目标锋检测效果差的体现及对应原因 
% 1）边界不清晰、目标遗漏
Unclear boundary segmentation and target omission often occur because of the loss of detailed information of STFs in the deep propagation of the network.
% 2）错误分类：相邻锋淹没 和强度相似的背景噪声难以区分
Moreover, insufficient utilization of context information, especially spatial clues, results in the misclassification of STFs, including (1) STFs are overwhelmed by adjacent large targets of other front classes (2) and the model struggles to distinguish between STFs and background noise when they have similar intensities.
% -------------------- 低PF锋类效果差
Front classes with low Pixel Frequency (PF, please see (\ref{PF})) are likely to contain more STFs, resulting in poor performance on evaluation metrics.
% 
% They have significantly fewer instances than that of other classes. 
% 
% Such class imbalance results in poor performance in the evaluation for detecting fronts with low PF.
% -------------------- LSENet举例
For example, in the quantitative results of LSENet\cite{LSENet}, the mIoU score reaches 71.25, while the IoU scores of two front classes, Front4 and Front9, fail to exceed 50.

% -------------------- 解决问题 
To address the above dilemma, we model multi-class ocean front detection as a semantic segmentation problem and propose the Dense Contextual Ensemble Network (DCENet) for the precise identification of STFs in remote sensing images.
% -------------------- 模型介绍  
% -------------------- 吹牛b 
DCENet can comprehensively perceive and utilize STF information.
% including global clues to determine the sea area corresponding to the front class, and local clues to determine the positional relationship between adjacent front classes.
% -------------------- 全局结构 编解码架构网络
Specifically, DCENet is an encoder-decoder architecture network\cite{UNet} based on a spatially enhanced contextual ensemble (SE-CE) structure.
% -------------------- DA Block 
% 编解码器中嵌入、密集的特征连接：锋的细节信息传递到网络的深层
Dense aggregation blocks (DA blocks) embedded in the encoder and decoder transfer the detailed information of fronts to the deep layers of the network by densely concatenating features.
% 提取锋的多尺度特征
% Dense Aggregation Blocks (DA Blocks) embedded in the encoder and decoder extract multi-scale features of fronts. 
% The dense connection between layers preserves the detailed information of fronts.
% -------------------- (SE-CE) structure
% SAM激活不同尺度的上下文信息，捕获像素间空间依赖关系
Additionally, the context information at different scales extracted in the encoder is activated by a spatial attention module (SAM), which captures the spatial dependencies between pixels.
% 密集上采样，丰富多尺度STF上下文信息
On the foundation of the skip connection, the SE-CE structure enables the encoder to establish connections with higher-level decoders through dense upsampling, enriching the multi-scale context information of the STF.
% 2）spatially enhanced contextual ensemble 
% DCENet establishes connections between the encoder and decoder based on the SE-CE structure.
% ---------- 损失函数介绍 ---------- 
% -------------------- 混合损失 fb loss + dice loss
Moreover, we design a hybrid loss function, combining frequency balance (FB) loss and Dice loss.
% fb loss 平衡每个锋类对总体损失的贡献
